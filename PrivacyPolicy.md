# HIPAA-Safe Privacy Policy for My Custom Fitness GPT
Last Updated: 11/22/2025

## 1. Purpose
This GPT is a personal fitness and wellness assistant used solely for lifestyle, exercise, and nutrition planning. It is not intended to handle medical information or provide medical advice. This assistant connects to my Airtable base only for the purpose of managing my personal fitness schedule and logging voluntary wellness information.

## 2. No Medical or PHI Data
This GPT is **not** designed to collect, store, transmit, or process any Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by HIPAA.  
Users (including me) should **not** enter medical diagnoses, medical treatment information, medications, clinical history, or any other regulated health information.

Any information I choose to enter is entirely voluntary and is limited to general wellness and lifestyle tracking such as:
- Workouts completed  
- Meal adherence  
- Water intake  
- Sleep duration  
- Mood, stress, and energy ratings  
- Body weight for general fitness progress  

These are **not** treated as medical data.  
This GPT is **not** a HIPAA-covered entity and does not offer HIPAA-compliant services.

## 3. Data Accessed by the GPT
When I request it, the GPT may access specific tables in my Airtable base:

- MealPlan  
- WorkoutPlan  
- WorkoutDifficulty  
- Record  

Only the fields necessary to fulfill my request are accessed.

## 4. How the GPT Uses My Data
The GPT uses wellness data exclusively to:
- Retrieve my scheduled meal plan
- Retrieve my scheduled workout plan
- Generate general fitness instructions
- Log non-medical wellness and lifestyle entries into my Airtable base
- Update workout difficulty settings when requested

This GPT does **not** analyze or interpret any data for medical purposes.

## 5. Information Sent to Airtable
The GPT only sends information to Airtable when I explicitly ask it to create or update a record.  
Information sent may include items such as:
- Workout completion  
- Meal completion  
- Water intake  
- Sleep hours  
- Mood, stress, or energy ratings  
- Daily calorie estimates  
- Weight for non-medical fitness tracking  

The GPT does **not** send any medical information.

## 6. Data Storage
This GPT does not store information.  
All persistent data resides in my Airtable base under my control.  
Conversations with the GPT may be stored by OpenAI as described in OpenAI’s policies, but this GPT does not store or retain independent records.

## 7. Data Sharing
This GPT does not share information with any third parties beyond Airtable, which I explicitly authorize using my own API key.  
I am responsible for the security and management of my Airtable token.

## 8. User Responsibility
I agree not to input any medical data, PHI, or information requiring HIPAA protection.  
I understand that the GPT cannot diagnose, treat, or manage any health or medical condition.

## 9. Control and Revocation
I may revoke Airtable access at any time by deleting or rotating my Airtable API token.  
I can also delete or modify any data in Airtable whenever I choose.

## 10. Contact
This GPT is created and maintained by me for personal use.  
I am responsible for overseeing its use and ensuring it remains limited to non-medical wellness tracking.
